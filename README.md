# Computational Musicology: Corpus Description

## Does the genre of a major music phenomenon like Tame Impala change due to popularity?

Tame Impala is a famous musical project led by Kevin Parker, mostly known for its *psychedelic rock*. With the 2015 album *Currents*, it made its breakthrough to the greater public and has continued to grow in listeners over the past few years. Interestingly, best-known songs from the exploded album are quite "mild" by psychedelic-rock standards. Since this somewhat softer version of the genre seems to be doing well, I am curious to what extent a music phenomenon like Tame Impala, in genre 'adapts' after success, relative to their earlier songs. Do they make what the general public wants to hear, or do they maintain their authentic style for a smaller group of psychedelic-rock fanatics?

The groups I want to compare within this corpus will be, first, the first singles from 2008 and 2009, the first album *Innerspeaker* from 2010 and *Lonerism* from 2013. To the second group I want to name all the songs after Currents (2015). The album on which they broke through (Currents) I want to assess herein separately by genre. 

The expectations I have at this moment are therefore that their earlier songs can be considered as harder, rougher, up-tempo and less "accessible" psychedelic rock, while the songs from Currents and thus everything that followed fit better within the genres *alternative/indie* and *(synth)pop*.

Songs that, in my opinion, typify both extremes in this are *The Bold Arrow of Time* from the album Innerspeaker (2010) as typical hard psychedelic rock versus *The less I know the better* from Currents (2015). Songs like *Nangs* and *Gossip* from that same album might be a bit off, as they could be better considered as *ambient music* and are hard to categorize in any of the aforementioned genres.
